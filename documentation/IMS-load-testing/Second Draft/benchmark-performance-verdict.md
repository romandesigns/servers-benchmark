## üöÄ Peak Throughput (Requests Per Second)

| Server        | 1 CPU / 1GB | 2 CPU / 2GB | 4 CPU / 4GB | Verdict      |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Bun Elysia    | 499.95      | 499.83      | 499.95      | ‚úÖ Maxed out  |
| Node Fastify  | 499.94      | 499.95      | 499.95      | ‚úÖ Maxed out  |
| .NET          | 495.25      | 497.93      | 498.57      | ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly under | 

‚û°Ô∏è **Fastify and Bun Elysia consistently reached max RPS**, while .NET was close, but a few RPS short at every tier.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Average Response Time

| Server        | 1 CPU / 1GB | 2 CPU / 2GB | 4 CPU / 4GB | Verdict        |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Bun Elysia    | 2.85 ms     | 2.45 ms     | 2.76 ms     | ‚úÖ Ultra-fast   |
| Node Fastify  | 2.55 ms     | 2.61 ms     | 3.51 ms     | ‚úÖ Ultra-fast   |
| .NET          | 19.18 ms    | 6.7 ms      | 5.54 ms     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher latency |

‚û°Ô∏è Fastify and Bun Elysia maintained sub-4ms latency, while .NET only approached those latencies with higher CPU allocation.

## üíæ Memory Usage

| Server        | 1 CPU / 1GB | 2 CPU / 2GB | 4 CPU / 4GB | Verdict        |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Bun Elysia    | ~62.1MB     | ~55.0MB     | ~62.6MB     | ‚úÖ Efficient    |
| Node Fastify  | ~45.1MB     | ~44.7MB     | ~47.8MB     | ‚úÖ Most efficient |
| .NET          | ~95.3MB     | ~96.9MB     | ~98.7MB     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Heaviest     |

‚û°Ô∏è Node Fastify used the least memory, followed by Bun Elysia. .NET consistently used about double.

## üßÆ Resource Efficiency Summary

| Metric        | Winner(s)         | .NET Standing        |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Peak RPS      | Fastify, Bun      | Slightly under       |
| Avg Latency   | Fastify, Bun      | Higher latency       |
| Memory Usage  | Fastify           | Heaviest             |
| CPU Usage     | Node < Bun < .NET | Highest (multi-core) |

---

## üßæ Final Verdict

‚úÖ **Fastify** and **Bun Elysia** deliver:
- **Maximum RPS** at all resource levels
- **Ultra-low latency** (sub-4ms)
- **Minimal memory footprint**

‚ö†Ô∏è **.NET** is highly stable, handles all requests with zero errors, and gets close to peak RPS, but:
- **Latency is notably higher at low resources**, only improving with more CPUs
- **Uses significantly more memory**
- **Uses far more CPU** as it scales up

---

## üîç Recommendation

- For **performance-first microservices**, **Fastify** or **Bun Elysia** are top picks.
- For teams invested in the **.NET ecosystem**, it remains a solid, stable option ‚Äî especially if raw speed isn't the highest priority.
